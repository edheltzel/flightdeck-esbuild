<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

The Flightdeck objective is to provide a unified starting point for all your Jamstack websites, by leveraging popular static-site-generators _(SSG)_.

This flavor of Flightdeck uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) with an opinionated workflow, keeping Eleventy in control of the entire development and build processes.

### Inspiration

Like other versions of Flightdeck, this is just an adaptation of the original [Flightdeck](https://github.com/flight-deck/Flightdeck-Jekyll) project that uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for its static site generation and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for all assets bundling. (The [Hugo](https://github.com/flight-deck/Flightdeck-Hugo) version, takes full advantage of Hugo's asset pipeline.)

Jérôme Coupé's post [Structuring Eleventy Projects](https://www.webstoemp.com/blog/eleventy-projects-structure/) served as inspiration for how this project is structured and over-time, things will shift as ideas change, but in 2022, we are shamelessly adopting the concept Jérôme Coupé outlines.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

All version of Flightdeck use NodeJS. So a very minimal and basic knowledge of Node and Git should be had when using Flightdeck as your launchpad.

> In the future, we plan to include Docker and make all Flightdeck starters available as a Yeoman and/or NPM package.

### Prerequisites

We are assuming that you already have Node with NPM and Git installed on your system – it is also ideal that you have the latest [LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) release of Node.
**As of this writing the current LTS release is `16.16.0`**

#### Dependencies

`pnpm` is our package manager of choice – we highly recommend you enable Node's [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html), this way all the `pnpm` commands are work out-of-the-box.

> Please be aware that this certainly won't be the most recent version of PNPM and as of this writing, PNPM is at version [7.5.0](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases).

Also, You can swap `pnpm` in favor of `yarn` or `npm` without any friction.

- pnpm

  ```sh
  corepack enable

  corepack prepare pnpm@7.5.0 --activate
  ```

### Installation

```shell
git clone https://github.com/flight-deck/flightdeck-for-eleventy.git
```

```shell
cd flightdeck-for-eleventy
pnpm install
```

<!-- USAGE -->

### Usage

There are just a few npm-scripts available, but the `start` command is where all the magic 🪄 happens – it will spin up the development server from Eleventy.

Again, the focus here is to keep Eleventy in control of the entire development and build processes, to keep things simple.

```shell
pnpm start
```

<details open>
  <summary>Available Scripts</summary>
  <pre>pnpm run

Lifecycle scripts:
start
cross-env ENVIRONMENT=dev eleventy --serve

Commands available via "pnpm run":
build
cross-env ENVIRONMENT=prod eleventy
images
optimizt src/assets/images
clean
./.scrub site
purge
./.scrub purge</pre>

Notice the funky `||` ? This is an attempt to provide cross platform compatibility for Linux/Unix, and Windows. If your terminal doesn’t know what it is, it will skip over it.

- `build` command - executes the production build of your site with Eleventy, includes HTML minification, compressed Sass, optimized images, and bundled javascript.
- `images` command - will optimize all image files inside of `/src/assets/images`, the files will be copied to `/dist/assets/images` with Eleventy's `addPassthroughCopy` but only when you run the development server.
- `clean` command - scrubs/removes the `dist/` and `.cache` directories
- `purge` command - scrubs/removes the `dist/`, `.cache`, `node_modules`, and any lock files from npm, yarn, or pnpm.

Both `clean` and `purge` are executed from a bash script keep the `package.json` as clean as possible.
