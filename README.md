## [🥱 TL;DR](#tldr)

#### A starter project for Eleventy with an opinionated workflow

The key concept here is to keep Eleventy in control of the entire development and build processes.

```shell
    gh repo clone edheltzel/flightdeck flightdeck && cd flightdeck && bun install && bun run start
```

**Build your project**

```shell
   bun run build
```

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## [🌟 About The Project](#about-the-project)

The flightdeck objective is to provide a unified starting point for all your Jamstack websites, by leveraging popular static-site-generators _(SSG)_.

This flavor of flightdeck uses [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) with an opinionated workflow without the support additional tools like Webpack, Parcel, or Gulp. This is to keep things simple and to **keep Eleventy in control of the entire development and build processes**.

### [💡 Inspiration](#inspiration)

Like other versions of flightdeck, this is just an adaptation of the original [flightdeck](https://github.com/edheltzel/flightdeck-for-jekyll) project that uses [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for its static site generation and [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) for all assets bundling. ►►► 🫠 For other versions of flightdeck, [👉 look here](https://github.com/edheltzel?tab=repositories&q=flightdeck)

Jérôme Coupé's post [Structuring Eleventy Projects](https://www.webstoemp.com/blog/eleventy-projects-structure/) served as inspiration for how this project is structured and over-time, things will shift as ideas change, but in 2022, we are shamelessly adopting the concept Jérôme Coupé outlines.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## [🧰 Getting Started](#getting-started)

All version of flightdeck use NodeJS. So a very minimal and basic knowledge of Node and Git should be had when using flightdeck as your launchpad.

> In the future, we plan to include Docker and make all flightdeck starters available as a Yeoman and/or NPM package.

### [🧯 Prerequisites](#prerequisites)

We are assuming that you already have Node with NPM (or another package manger, like Bun/Pnpm/Yarn) and Git installed on your system – it is also ideal that you have the latest [LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) release of Node. **As of this writing the current LTS release is `20.12.2`**

#### [🤖 Dependencies](#dependencies)

##### [Package Managers](#package-managers)

**Package managers are like dotfiles, everyone has their own preference.**

We are using [Bun](https://bun.sh) as our package manager.

But, you can swap `bun` in favor of your preferences 👉 [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) , [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Use whatever you want 👍 just be sure to update the `package.json` with what ever flavor you choose to use:

- change `preview` with your preference
- change `upgrade` with your preference
- remove `packageManager` from `package.json`

<details>
 <summary><strong>Corepack Deprecated 🚪</strong></summary>

> [Node.js Takes Steps Towards Removing Corepack by Sarah Gooding](https://socket.dev/blog/node-js-takes-steps-towards-removing-corepack)

If you're using an older version of Node, it's highly recommended that you enable Node's [corepack](https://nodejs.org/api/corepack.html), this way Yarn and PNPM are included in your toolbox without the need to install them separately.

> Please be aware that this certainly won't be the most recent version of PNPM/Yarn.

- pnpm and yarn

  ```sh
  corepack enable

  corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
  corepack prepare yarn@latest --activate
  ```

</details>

### ⚙[Installation](#installation)

Using `git` in the terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/edheltzel/flightdeck.git
```

```shell
cd flightdeck
bun install
```

Using `gh` in the terminal:

```shell
gh repo clone edheltzel/flightdeck
```

```shell
cd flightdeck
bun install
```

### [🏃‍♂️ Run Locally](#run-locally)

There are just a few npm-:150
available, but the `start` command is where all the magic 🪄 happens – it will spin up the development server from Eleventy.

Again, the focus here is to keep Eleventy in control of the entire development and build processes, to keep things simple.

```shell
bun run start
```

<details>
  <summary>Available Run Commands</summary>

    Lifecycle scripts:
    start
    eleventy --serve

    Commands available via "bun run":
     dev
      bun run clean && bun run start
     build
      ENV=prod eleventy
     debug
      DEBUG=Eleventy* eleventy
     deploy
      wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name my-flightdeck --commit-message "local build & deploy"
     preview
      bun run clean && bun run build && bunx http-server dist -p 54321
     check
      biome check
     format
      biome format --
     lint
      biome lint --
     clean
      ./.scrub.sh site
     purge
      ./.scrub.sh purge
     upgrade
      bunx npm-check-updates -ui
     release
      gh release create v$npm_package_version --generate-notes --latest

</details>

- `preinstall` command - (removed when migrating to Bun) previously ensured only pnpm was used.
- `dev` command - removes the existing `dist` and starts the development server with Eleventy.
- `start` command - starts the development server with Eleventy.
- `build` command - executes the production build of your site with Eleventy, includes HTML minification, compressed Sass, optimized images, and bundled javascript.
  - for our workflow, Cloudflare handles the DNS while Cloudflare Pages does the building and hosting - Cloudflare's Auto Minify minifies the HTML, CSS, and JS. You can easily add minification to the build process by adding a plugin to Eleventy.
- `debug` command - runs the development server with Eleventy with debug logging enabled.
- `deploy` command - deploys the "manual" production build to Cloudflare Pages.
- `preview` command - spins up a local server to preview the production build.
- `check` command - runs biome lint and format at the same time JS/TS/CSS, see `biome.json`.
  - ie: `bun run check ./src/assets/js/app.js`
- `format` command - uses biome to format JS/TS/CSS, see `biome.json`.
  - ie: `bun run format ./src/assets/js/app.js`
- `lint` command - uses biome to lint JS/TS/CSS, see `biome.json`.
  - ie: `bun run lint ./src/assets/js/app.js`
- `clean` command - scrubs/removes the `dist/` and `.cache` directories
- `purge` command - scrubs/removes the `dist/`, `.cache`, `node_modules`, and any lock files from npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun. - 🧼 A fresh install.
  - **👀 NOTE: Both `clean` and `purge` are executed from a bash script**
- `upgrade` command - uses `bunx npm-check-updates -ui` to upgrade dependencies to their latest versions and updates the `package.json` - Bun handles this efficiently with its fast package resolution.
- `release` command - creates a new release on GitHub.

### [‍🚀 Deployments](#deployments)

Deployments for this project are completely up to you and your needs, we are fans of [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/), which is why you'll find a `.node-version` file, [Cloudflare Pages currently supports Node v18.17.1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/language-support-and-tools/#supported-languages-and-tools). Some other really good and popular options are GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, and Render. **Your call on what you use.**

##### Note - Environment Variables

Don't forget to create your own `.env` with whatever environment variables you need for your project.

<!-- File Structure -->

### [📁 File Structure](#file-structure)

flightdeck is a very opinionated starter kit, so the file structure is very specific to our needs. All the Eleventy configuration is done in the `.eleventy.js` file, but it is broken down into sections for easier navigation and maintain. All Eleventy configuration options are available, see the [Eleventy Docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/) for more information.

<!-- USAGE -->

### [👀 Usage](#usage)

The core concept of flightdeck to keep 11ty in charge of all the DX so you can focus on creating content.

flightdeck makes a lot of assumptions and is very opinionated - but having a good idea of how Eleventy's [data cascade](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/data-cascade/) works is always nice, as well as having some understanding on [template inherence](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html#template-inheritance) in Nunjucks will go a long way. **But is not needed**

For making changes to the way flightdeck pilots Eleventy, you will want to reference the `./src/_flightdeck` directory. This is where all the Eleventy configuration is done, but it is broken down into sections for easier navigation and maintainability.

Inside the `./src/_flightdeck` directory, you will find the following directories:

- `./src/_flightdeck/filters` - where all Universal filters are added to Eleventy templates. Currently we use Nunjucks for our templates, so all filters are added to the Nunjucks environment, but are easily adapted to other template engines, like Liquid.
- `./src/_flightdeck/shortcodes` - where all shortcodes are added to extend the functionality of the content you are creating. We consider shortcodes content altering and not UI focused. The idea is to create shortcodes that make writing content easier and more enjoyable.
- `./src/_flightdeck/transforms` - where all transforms are added to templates, javascript, styles, and images.

All the directories have a corresponding file that is used to import all the files in the directory. Each of these files are imported into `.eleventy.js` as modules.

- `./src/_flightdeck/filters.js`
- `./src/_flightdeck/plugins.js` - this file controls Eleventy plugins that modify content.
- `./src/_flightdeck/shortcodes.js`
- `./src/_flightdeck/transforms.js`
- `./src/_flightdeck/workflow.js` - this file controls the Eleventy dev server.

flightdeck comes with a custom image transform plugin that watches for changes in the `./src/assets/images` directory and then optimizes any new or changed images, copies it to the output destination directory `./dist/assets/images`. Since we are using the the [Eleventy Image Plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image) under-the-hood, it is smart enough to know if an image has already been optimized, we don't need to worry about that. **Just set it and forget it.**

> **PLEASE NOTE:** This feature does add a little overhead to the initial build process, which is why it is disabled by default.

If you would like the enable this feature just set `useImageDirTransform: true` in `.eleventy.js` and you're good to go.

All Eleventy configuration options are available, see the [Eleventy Docs](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/config/) for more information.

If you're looking to extend or further configure your project with other NPM modules, Eleventy plugins, or ESBuild Plugins, just reference the appropriate documentation.

- [Eleventy Docs](https://11ty.dev)
- [Nunjucks Docs](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/templating.html)
- [ESBuild Docs](https://esbuild.github.io/plugins/)
- [Biome Docs](https://docs.biomejs.dev/)
- [LightningCSS Docs](https://lightningcss.dev/)
- [Sass Docs](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/)
- [NPM Package Docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/using-npm-packages-in-your-projects)

#### [💅 Using Sass/Scss](#using-sass)

If you'd rather us Scss to write you styles you'll need to do a few things to set it up:

1. Install `sass`, `eleventy-plugin-sass`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer`
   - see [eleventy-sass repo](https://github.com/kentaroi/eleventy-sass) for documentation.
2. Update the `src/_flightdeck/transform.js` file and the `src/_flightdeck/transforms/_scss.js`
3. Make sure to remove the `lightningcss` module
4. Update your `src/assets/styles` directory to fit your Scss workflow.

- If you want to still use Scss, it is still apart of the package dependencies along with PostCSS.
  - please reference `_flightdeck/transforms.js` and `_flightdeck/transforms/_scss.js`
  - see [eleventy-sass repo](https://github.com/kentaroi/eleventy-sass) for documentation.
  - see [picocss docs](https://picocss.com/docs/sass#custom-theme) for theming.
- If you do not want the additional dependencies just run `bun remove sass eleventy-sass postcss autoprefixer @picocss/pico`

<!-- #region Autopilot -->

#### [👨‍🚀 Autopilot Theme](#autopilot)

**WIP** Autopilot, is a custom minimal css framework for semantic HTML.

The goal of Autopilot, is to provide a simple, yet powerful, set of default styles to help build your UI components.

<!-- #endregion Autopilot -->

<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

<!-- know issues-->

## [🐛 Known Issues](#known-issues)

### [Markdown workarounds](#markdown-workarounds)

When using the markdown-it-attrs plugin, you'll encounter a build issue when applying IDs to elements, using the `{#id}` syntax. This is a result of setting the Eleventy config to use Nunjucks as the template engine for markdown files -> `markdownTemplateEngine: "njk"`. Which in turn treats the `{#` as the start of a Nunjucks comment. **To work around this, use the attribute syntax `{id=id}` instead of `{#id}`.**

<!-- ROADMAP -->
